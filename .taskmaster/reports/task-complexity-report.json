			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Initialize NestJS Project Structure",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down NestJS project initialization into: CLI project generation, dependency installation and configuration, basic folder structure setup, and build/run script configuration with health check endpoint.",
			"reasoning": "Low-medium complexity as this is standard NestJS scaffolding with well-documented CLI commands. Multiple discrete steps but each is straightforward."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Configure SQLite Database with TypeORM",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: TypeORM module configuration, CronJob entity creation with all fields and validations, ExecutionLog entity with relationships, database connection setup and data directory creation, and entity relationship testing.",
			"reasoning": "Medium-high complexity due to two complex entities with relationships, JSON field handling, enum types, and proper TypeORM configuration. Requires careful relationship modeling."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Schedule Parser Service",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: repeat interval parsing logic (5s, 1m, 1h format), cron expression validation using node-cron, schedule validation service with edge cases, and next execution time calculation functionality.",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity requiring regex parsing, third-party cron library integration, and comprehensive validation logic with edge cases."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Create CronJob CRUD Controller and DTOs",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into: DTO creation with validation decorators, controller endpoints implementation (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), service layer with TypeORM repository, validation middleware setup, error handling and HTTP exceptions, and Swagger API documentation.",
			"reasoning": "Medium-high complexity as it's a complete REST API with validation, error handling, and documentation. Multiple interconnected components requiring careful coordination."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement HTTP Client Service",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: HTTP client service setup with @nestjs/axios, request execution logic with timeout and headers, response handling and body size limiting, database logging integration, and retry logic implementation for network failures.",
			"reasoning": "Medium-high complexity involving HTTP client configuration, error handling, response processing, database integration, and retry mechanisms."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Build Core Scheduler Service",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: SchedulerRegistry service setup, dynamic job registration for intervals and cron, job persistence and loading on startup, job execution wrapper with logging, job status tracking system, and job lifecycle management (add/remove/update).",
			"reasoning": "High complexity as it's the core business logic requiring scheduler integration, job persistence, dynamic registration, and coordination with multiple other services."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Create Manual Job Execution Controller",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into: manual trigger endpoint implementation, job validation and execution logic, and rate limiting with proper error handling and logging.",
			"reasoning": "Medium-low complexity as it builds on existing HTTP client and validation services. Straightforward controller with some business logic."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Execution Logs Controller and Cleanup Service",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: log viewing API with pagination and filtering, statistics endpoint for counts and metrics, log search functionality, automated cleanup service with cron scheduling, and response body truncation handling.",
			"reasoning": "Medium-high complexity involving complex queries, pagination, scheduled cleanup, and multiple API endpoints with different response formats."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Build Angular Frontend Application",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into: Angular project setup and routing, job list component with status indicators, job form component with reactive forms, job details component with execution history, log viewer component, HTTP services for API integration, responsive design implementation, and build integration with NestJS serving.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity as it's a complete SPA with multiple components, services, forms, real-time updates, responsive design, and integration with backend APIs."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Configure Docker Container and Production Build",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: multi-stage Dockerfile creation, production build configuration for both Angular and NestJS, environment variable and volume setup, health checks and graceful shutdown implementation, and documentation and deployment examples.",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity involving Docker best practices, multi-stage builds, production configurations, and proper containerization of full-stack application."
